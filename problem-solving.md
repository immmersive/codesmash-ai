# General Problem Solving Method

Once we have decided that ideas will be the starting point of our investigation, we can conclude that these ideas need to be used in the process of problem solving. We define our problem solving process in terms of our main Axiom, which in terms of ideas, says that we should use the best idea to solve the problem at hand.

So, we can conclude that the problem solving process makes a distinction between different ideas and presents the one which will actually solve the problem. Since we are actually concerned with solving all problems, we need to create a general problem solving method in order to take into account all possible ideas which will then give as a result the solution to the problem at hand.

Furthermore, since we have no reason to choose one idea as our starting point, or the goal either, the question which now arises is the following one

> _**How should the problem be solved?**_

The question is more problematic than it might seem at first. As an example let us take the old problem of the **Trolley Problem**. The problem ask us to choose between the lives of either 5 or 1 person, and we are the ones who will decide which of the people will live and which won't. 

It is quite clear that when people go and try to solve this problem they either choose some ethical or utilitarian standpoint. It should be clear that the discussion between two people at this point can go on indefinitely since if they contradictory views, they will never come together and come to the same conclusion, effectively not being able to solve the problem. Even if we were to have a single person solving the problem, the solution could be completely arbitrary at any point. 

We propose that there is only one way to formulate this problem and that is to ask the following question first.

> _**What are you trying to achieve by solving this problem?**_

If we actually adopt this viewpoint, then everything falls into place for us. If we can answer the question and decided on what we want to achieve, then we have created a question which is being answered with respect to a goal we are trying to achieve. From here, we can easily apply our main Axiom and conclude that the answer now isn't at all arbitrary when it comes to answering the original question. Because now we can apply the main Axiom to the question and find the best answer to the question which actually leads to what we wanted to achieve by solving this problem.

Now, any arbitrariness is gone and both sides can agree what the best course of action is. Should both sides not agree on what should actually be achieved, they can simply apply the main Axiom on some more base idea, until they find common ground and then work from there. Of course, in the case of there being more than one person who is making the decision, it is imperative that they first agree, that they actually want to agree.
