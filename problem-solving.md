# General Problem Solving Method

Once we have decided that ideas will be the starting point of our investigation, we can conclude that these ideas need to be used in the process of problem solving. We define our problem solving process in terms of our main Axiom, which in terms of ideas, says that we should use the best idea to solve the problem at hand.

So, we can conclude that the problem solving process makes a distinction between different ideas and presents the one which will actually solve the problem.

Since we are actually concerned with solving all problems, we need to create a general problem solving method in order to take into account all possible ideas which will then give as a result the solution to the problem at hand.
