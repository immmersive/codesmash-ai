# The Minimal AGI Model

As opposed to narrow AI, the general artificial intelligence in question needs to learn on its own. This is the most fundamental difference between AI and AGI. In all current AI systems, especially the LLM-based ones, the AI system is trained on large amount of data. From our pragmatic understanding, it is clear what is actually going on. The system is primed to be able to solve a particular problem. It is trained on a set of data, which is specific to a certain problem domain. In other words, it is trained specifically with respect to the problem the system is trying to solve. This is a clear pragmatic approach. 

Once trained, the system will try to statistically find the correct solution, based on what it has seen from the training data. The problem lies in the fact that due to the NFL theorem, the system is now unable to solve any other type of problem, which it has not been trained on. As we have mentioned before, certain algorithms work better on certain problem domains, while they perform worse, on some other problem domains. Thus, if there was human input, which has trained the AI system on data, it has done so with respect to the knowledge the person already knew that the LLM.based approach will work well on this particular problem domain. Furthermore, if the system was trained on understanding images of dogs, then we are expected to ask the system if he can tell if a picture is of a dog or not.

But we are not going to expect the system to be able to tell if a picture it is shown is a car, if it has not been shown what a car is. Once the system has been trained, it will only be optimal for the domain it has been trained on. As opposed to human problem solvers, who even though don't know what the solution to a noven problem is, will go out of their way and find out how to solve a problem. We can then say, that humans either solve problems they know how to solve and if they don't know how to solve a problem, they create a new approach which can then solve the problem.

Our AGI system is therefore supposed to do the same thing. If it is tasked with solvign a problem it doesn't know how to solve, it needs to find an approach, i.e. and algorithm, which will be able to solve the problem.
