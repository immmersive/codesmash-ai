### **Reworking the Pragmatic Maxim**

#### **Original Definition**
The **Pragmatic Maxim** originally suggests that the meaning of a concept or idea lies in its practical effects and consequences. According to Charles Sanders Peirce, one of the founders of Pragmatism, the meaning of a concept can be understood by considering what practical effects the object of the concept might have and how those effects could potentially influence our experiences.

#### **New Problem-Solving Approach**
In our problem-solving framework, we adopt a refined version of the Pragmatic Maxim:

**"Ideas should be evaluated based on how useful they are with respect to the goal we are trying to achieve."**

This redefinition shifts the focus from the broad practical consequences of an idea to a more goal-oriented assessment. The central criterion for evaluating an idea is its utility in achieving a specific objective.

#### **Formalization of the New Definition**

1. **Objective**  
   The goal is to evaluate ideas based on their utility in solving a particular problem or achieving a specific goal.

2. **Components**
   - **Idea (I)**: A concept, hypothesis, or proposed solution that is being considered in the context of problem-solving.
   - **Goal (G)**: The specific objective or desired outcome that the problem-solver aims to achieve.
   - **Utility Function (U)**: A function that measures the usefulness or effectiveness of an idea <i>I</i> in achieving the goal <i>G</i>.

3. **Utility Function**
   The utility of an idea <i>I</i> with respect to a goal <i>G</i> can be formalized as:

   \[
   U(I, G) = f(P<sub>G</sub>, P<sub>I</sub>)
   \]

   where:
   - <i>P<sub>G</sub></i> represents the set of patterns or conditions that define the goal <i>G</i>.
   - <i>P<sub>I</sub></i> represents the set of patterns or transformations proposed by the idea <i>I</i> to achieve <i>P<sub>G</sub></i>.
   - <i>f(P<sub>G</sub>, P<sub>I</sub>)</i> is a function that measures how well the patterns <i>P<sub>I</sub></i> align with or lead to the patterns <i>P<sub>G</sub></i>, reflecting the effectiveness of the idea in achieving the goal.

4. **Evaluation Process**
   - **Assessment**: Evaluate the idea <i>I</i> by determining how closely its proposed patterns <i>P<sub>I</sub></i> align with the desired patterns <i>P<sub>G</sub></i>.
   - **Comparison**: Compare the utility <i>U(I, G)</i> of different ideas to identify which one offers the highest utility with respect to the goal.
   - **Selection**: Select the idea with the highest utility as the optimal solution for achieving the goal.

5. **Iterative Refinement**
   - If the selected idea <i>I</i> does not fully achieve the goal <i>G</i>, refine or adjust the idea based on feedback and re-evaluate its utility.
   - This process is iterative, allowing for continuous improvement of ideas until the goal is optimally achieved.

#### **Summary**
The reworked Pragmatic Maxim in this problem-solving framework emphasizes a goal-oriented evaluation of ideas. By formalizing the concept of utility, we create a structured approach to assess how well an idea helps achieve a specific objective. This method ensures that the most effective and practical solutions are selected, aligning with the overarching principle of Pragmatism while focusing on tangible problem-solving outcomes.
