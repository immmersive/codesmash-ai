# Limits of Human Reasoning
 
The problem with certain approaches is that they don't recognize their limits. Thus, they think they are universally applicable. This makes them suboptimal because in certain cases, they will not solve the problem at hand. Thus we need to understand the limits of applicability of an idea in order to utilize it in the correct manner. As we have seen previously, human mind never has access to absolute truth, thus, the information we are working under are always subject to change. But this is not the only limit. The further limitation is actually limit in actual problem solving, which comes bouth from the human mind and in problems we can approach.

Certain problems are solvable when defined properly. Other problems are not solvable. Thus, in our case, we shall only focus on solvable problems. There are 2 kind of problems which are unsolvable.

# Theoretically Unsolvable Problems

Let us suppose that our task is to find the last digit of number pi. Since according to our definition, pi is a transcendental number, it does not have the last digit. Thus, by definition, there is no solution to this problem, even in theory

# Practically Unsolvable Problems

On the other hand, let us suppose that our task is to represent a number which requires n+1 digits to represent, where n is the number of elementary particles in teh universe. Since this would require more actual matter than there exists int eh universe, this problem is also unsolvable. As opposed to the previous problem, had we actually had more matter at our disposal, for example, for outside of this universe, we would indeed be able to solve this problem.
