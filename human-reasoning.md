# Limits of Human Reasoning
 
Seeing as how all our ideas are always subject to change, because we don't have access to absolute knowledge, then the only thing we are left with is to choose the best current knowledge to solve problems. We need to be able to choose appropriate ideas for the approapriate moment, as we have mentioned previously, our Main Axiom will guide us in choosing the correct ideas.

The problem with certain approaches is that they don't recognize their limits. Thus, they think they are universally applicable. This makes them suboptimal because in certain cases, they will not solve the problem at hand. Thus we need to understand the limits of applicability of an idea in order to utilize it in the correct manner. As we have seen previously, human mind never has access to absolute truth, thus, the information we are working under are always subject to change. But this is not the only limit. The further limitation is actually limit in actual problem solving, which comes both from the human mind and in problems we can approach.
 
Furthermore, it is actually irrelevant whether the world is static or changing, when it comes to discovery using human reasoning. That is whether there is absolute truth or not. Due to our mental limits, our ability to discover is limited. Therefore, just because we are not finding any new answers to old questions like $1+1=?$, doesn't mean that we found the ultimate truth, with our answer being $1+1=2$. It might very well be that our mental resolution has hit a limit and we cannot resolve a lower answer, than what we already have. Just like we couldn't imagine any molecular explanation for cellular life before the invention of the microscope.

# Example

Let us now take into account the following situation. If we were to ask a person the following question, what could we expect as an answer?

> _**What is water in its totality?**_

The answer might appear quite simple and the person might something like the following:

> _**When under 0°C it is solid matter, when at room temperature it is liquid and when it is at or above 100°C it is gaseous.**_

We could then suppose that we ask the same question to another people, but this time, one living at the North Pole. In this case, we might expect the following answer, assuming that it has never been hot enough for the person to observe water boiling.

> _**When under 0°C it is solid matter and when at room temperature it is liquid.**_

We would then turn and ask the same question to a person who has lived his whole life near the Equator and never observed cold weather or ice and get an answer similar to this.

> _**When at room temperature it is liquid and when it is at or above 100°C it is gaseous.**_

It should be clear from these examples that the answers we get from each person is based on what they have experienced. The people who have never experienced water in its solid form can't be expected to propose that as an answer to our question, or more in general, a solution to a problem. At this point, we have to ask ourselves, what did the person who mentioned all 3 states of water, base his answer on? Its easy to understand that his answer was based on experience as well. But since that's the case, it should be easy to conclude that not even these 3 states of matter have to fully describe what water actually is, since there could be more states, which that person hasn't experienced yet.

Regardless of human mind being material or not, the effects we see of our mind in the material world are limited by limits of computation. Certain problems are solvable when defined properly. Other problems are not solvable. Thus, in our case, we shall only focus on solvable problems. There are 2 kind of problems which are unsolvable.

**Theoretically Unsolvable Problems**

Let us suppose that our task is to find the last digit of number $π$. Since according to our definition, $π$ is a transcendental number, it does not have the last digit. Thus, by definition, there is no solution to this problem, even in theory.

**Practically Unsolvable Problems**

On the other hand, let us suppose that our task is to represent a number which requires $n+1$ digits to represent, where $n$ is the number of elementary particles in the universe. Since this would require more actual matter than there exists in the universe, this problem is also unsolvable. As opposed to the previous problem, had we actually had more matter at our disposal, for example, for outside of this universe, we would indeed be able to solve this problem.

**Solvable Problems**

From here on, we will only focus on the solvable problems, which are solvable in principle and in practice. Therefore, when we say our goal is to solve all problems, we are only concerned with solvable problems as defined here.

# Inference to the Best Explanation

Seeing as how human reasoning is limited in various ways, the information, based on which we are reaching decisions is incomplete. Yet, if we want to actually solve the problem at hand, we need to act. We shall now use our main Axiom and conclude that we should use the best knowledge at hand, to base our decision on, when trying to solve a problem. Thus from the idea of using the right tool for the right job, we can concluide that we need to use the best knowledge available to make a decision in order to solve the problem at hand.

Since whatever we currently have is the best knowledge at hand, we can proceed with problem solving based on our current information. This system of reasoning is also known as the Inference to the Best Explanation. Seeing as how the problem needs to be saved and there is no other information available, this is by definition the only and also the best information to solve the problem with. It should also be clear that in many cases, this approach will not actually solve the problem, but since it is the only way we can proceed, we shall move forward from here.

**Conclusion**

When it comes to our problem solving approach, we are going to accept the notion that we are always going to solve problems based on ideas we come up with. Seeing as how there are limits to the ideas we can have for various reasons, we are going to treat all ideas as temporary and not assign any special value to any idea a priori. There will be an open possibility on all ideas being the solution to a problem. Thus, when selecting ideas as solutions to problems, from our Main Axiom, that we should do it based on the Inference to the Best Explanation.
