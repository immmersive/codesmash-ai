# Thinking

In this chapter we need to present a model of a general thinking process.

# Understanding

In order to solve a problem, we first need to understand it. To understand something, would mean to have an object represented as an idea, which means a pattern, which means as a set of models. These models are then put in a relation to things we can do to solve some problems. This aligns with our Pragmatic Maxim. So, understanding means, the totality of relations between our representations and what they can be used to achieve.

# Problem solving through thinking

At this point, we should start defining what problem solving is from a perspective of a thinking process. For us, this would imply coming up with ideas. These ideas would then be represented as patterns. The problem would be represented as pattern as well. We would then create a hierarchy of patterns, based on different representations of these ideas as patterns. They would be placed in a hierarchy, based on certain features which are relevant to solving problems. We call this the World model. These patterns would then be used to present solution to the problem. We would then compare the problem at hand and our current state with the current model of the world. Based on this, we would then choose the correct pattern from the hierarchy efficiently and present it as the solution to the problem.
