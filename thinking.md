# Thinking

In this chapter we need to present a model of a general thinking process.

# Understanding

In order to solve a problem, we first need to understand it. To understand something, would mean to have an object represented as an idea, which means a pattern, which means as a set of models. These models are then put in a relation to things we can do to solve some problems. This aligns with our Pragmatic Maxim. So, understanding means, the totality of relations between our representations and what they can be used to achieve.
