# The Pragmatic Maxim as an Optimization Problem

The new Pragmatic Maxim states that ideas should be evaluated based on how useful they are with respect to the goal we are trying to achieve. This can be understood as an optimization problem where:

- Objective: Maximize the utility of an idea concerning the goal.

- Variables: The different ideas or approaches that could potentially solve the problem.

- Constraints: The resources available, the context of the problem, and any limitations on what is feasible.

In this optimization problem, you are essentially trying to find the idea $Iâˆ—$ that yields the highest utility $U(I)$ with respect to the goal $G$, given the constraints $C$. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

```math
\text{Maximize U(I) subject to constraints C}
```

The idea that maximizes the utility is considered the most "true" or valid in this context because it is the optimal solution to the problem.
