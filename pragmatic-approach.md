I have previously established that reasoning about absolute truth is meaningless. Since the search for absolute truth will likely lead to no results, we are only left with proposing useful explanations for the world around us, so we can get by.

Every single philosophical idea, is exclusive by design. This means, that if you subscribe to a philosophical idea, which is in conflict with another idea, you cannot hold both views. The consequence of this is that we are eliminating a large body of philosophical work, for the crude ideas of "consistency".

The only solution to this problem is the adoption of Pragmatism as the base philosophical framework. Once we have done that, we can accept the "use the right tool for the right job" approach to problem-solving.

When we have adopted this view, literally all philosophical ideas become available to us. We can then use them to solve problems whenever they fit the actual problem. In other words, we are using the right tool to solve the right jobs.

From this it follows, that no philosophical idea is considered true, or more true than any other one. They stop being mutually exclusive, and we use them whenever they fit our problem.
