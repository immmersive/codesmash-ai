# Pragmatism

Our General Problem Solving Method will be based on our main Axiom which states that we should - use the right tool for the right job.

In order to tackle problems in a general sense, we can present Pragmatism as a philosophical system, from which we can extract and also redefine certain ideas which will become useful in creating this general problem solving method.

Our goal at present is to use the best current knowledge, in our case the meta-knowledge and create an object-model which will then be used to construct the general problem solving method.

# Pragmatic Analysis

Our general problem solving method will be titled Pragmatic Analysis. We can actually understand that certain types of ideas, that is, knowledge is more general than other types of knowledge. This is especially noticeable in sciences, where Philosophy is considered most general, then we move down the hierarchy to mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology. It should be clear, for example, that Biology only deals with living beings, while chemistry, being on a higher, more general level, deals with both organic and inorganic materials.

Therefrore, if we want to understand as many ideas as possible, we should start from a philosophical system. The question now is, which system we should choose as the starting point?

This will be the philosophy of Pragmatisam, which when interpreted appropriately, becomes the general system for interpretation of ideas.

It has been a constant view in the philosophical community to view different philosophical systems as compeeting with each other. This is not an appropriate view from our perspective. For example, Idealism and Materialism are clearly in contradiction, when it comes to understanding the world around us. By adopting the competition view of ideas, we immediately remove other ideas from our toolset. We then go agains our main Axiom, because at some point, it could be the case that our chosen idea is not the correct tool for the job, i.e. it is not the correct solution.

As opposed to the competition view, we shall adopt the complement view of ideas in general. The idea here, is to accept that no idea will always be the best solution to our problem and that we should use ideas when it is appropriate to do so. When it comes to Pragmatism, accepting this philosophical view, actually allows us to not reject any of existing philosophical ideas. It actually tells us that we should use other ideas when it suits us on a case by case basis. 

Even if two philosophical views contradict each other, it should not matter to us if at the end of the day, we can solve a problem. For example, if we never decide to invoke these two philosophical views at the same time, then we shall never run into a contradiction. Therefore, it is irrelevant that the contradiction exists. Furthermore, contradictions are just an ide like any other and as we have stated previously, we can not confirm if any idea is actually absolute truth. Thus, we have no justification to dismiss contradictions altogether either.

The only evaluation mechanism for any idea which we can always rely on, is our main Axiom.

When it comes to ideas, it is important to take into account the following example from William James.

> This human witness tries to get sight of the squirrel by moving rapidly round the tree, but no matter how fast he goes, the squirrel moves as fast in the opposite direction … so that never a glimpse of him is caught. The resultant metaphysical problem now is this: Does the man go round the squirrel or not?

We can analyze the example as follows.

> James proposed that which answer is correct depends on what you ‘practically mean’ by ‘going round’. If you mean passing from north of the squirrel, east, south, then west, then the answer is ‘yes’. If, on the other hand, you mean in front of him, to his right, behind him, to his left, and then in front of him again, then the answer is ‘no’.

It should be now clear that by creating definitions, that is distinct patterns which represent ideas, we can use them to different ends. If we then decide to evaluate an idea with respect to a goal, then it is easy to actually find the solution. Had we not had a goal, with respect to which we can solve a problem, then the statement can be interpreted in infinite ways and any interpretation could be valid. Thus, it becomes useless. By constraining the definitions to those which get us to a specific goal, we can specifically choose a definition which we know will work in a certain case when solving a problem at hand.
