# Pragmatism

Our General Problem Solving Method will be based on our main Axiom which states that we should - use the right tool for the right job.

In order to tackle problems in a general sense, we can present Pragmatism as a philosophical system, from which we can extract and also redefine certain ideas which will become useful in creating this general problem solving method.

Our goal at present is to use the best current knowledge, in our case the meta-knowledge and create an object-model which will then be used to construct the general problem solving method.

# Pragmatic Analysis

Our general problem solving method will be titled Pragmatic Analysis. We can actually understand that certain types of ideas, that is, knowledge is more general than other types of knowledge. This is especially noticeable in sciences, where Philosophy is considered most general, then we move down the hierarchy to mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology. It should be clear, for example, that Biology only deals with living beings, while chemistry, being on a higher, more general level, deals with both organic and inorganic materials.

Therefrore, if we want to understand as many ideas as possible, we should start from a philosophical system. The question now is, which system we should choose as the starting point?

This will be the philosophy of Pragmatisam, which when interpreted appropriately, becomes the general system for interpretation of ideas.
