# Pragmatism

Our General Problem Solving Method will be based on our main Axiom which states that we should - use the right tool for the right job.

In order to tackle problems in a general sense, we can present Pragmatism as a philosophical system, from which we can extract and also redefine certain ideas which will become useful in creating this general problem solving method.

Our goal at present is to use the best current knowledge, in our case the meta-knowledge and create an object-model which will then be used to construct the general problem solving method.

# Pragmatic Analysis

Our general problem solving method will be titled Pragmatic Analysis. We can actually understand that certain types of ideas, that is, knowledge is more general than other types of knowledge. This is especially noticeable in sciences, where Philosophy is considered most general, then we move down the hierarchy to mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology. It should be clear, for example, that Biology only deals with living beings, while chemistry, being on a higher, more general level, deals with both organic and inorganic materials.

Therefrore, if we want to understand as many ideas as possible, we should start from a philosophical system. The question now is, which system we should choose as the starting point?

This will be the philosophy of Pragmatisam, which when interpreted appropriately, becomes the general system for interpretation of ideas.

It has been a constant view in the philosophical community to view different philosophical systems as compeeting with each other. This is not an appropriate view from our perspective. For example, Idealism and Materialism are clearly in contradiction, when it comes to understanding the world around us. By adopting the competition view of ideas, we immediately remove other ideas from our toolset. We then go agains our main Axiom, because at some point, it could be the case that our chosen idea is not the correct tool for the job, i.e. it is not the correct solution.

As opposed to the competition view, we shall adopt the complement view of ideas in general. The idea here, is to accept that no idea will always be the best solution to our problem and that we should use ideas when it is appropriate to do so. When it comes to Pragmatism, accepting this philosophical view, actually allows us to not reject any of existing philosophical ideas. It actually tells us that we should use other ideas when it suits us on a case by case basis. 

Even if two philosophical views contradict each other, it should not matter to us if at the end of the day, we can solve a problem. For example, if we never decide to invoke these two philosophical views at the same time, then we shall never run into a contradiction. Therefore, it is irrelevant that the contradiction exists. Furthermore, contradictions are just an ide like any other and as we have stated previously, we can not confirm if any idea is actually absolute truth. Thus, we have no justification to dismiss contradictions altogether either.

The only evaluation mechanism for any idea which we can always rely on, is our main Axiom.

# Example

For example, if we were to accept a certain philosophical view, from an exclusionary perspective, we would need to reject a vast array of all possible philosophical ideas, yet they indeed have some merit when analyzing ideas as well. In the case A) if we were to accept Intuitionism, we would be pressed to reject all ideas which contradict intuitionistic ideas. We simply reject them because they are in opposition to our chosen view. On the other hand, in the case of choice B) if we accept Pragmatism as our starting point, from an inclusionary perspective, we now logically open a vast array of all possible philosophical ideas to us. All these ideas are at our disposal, in order for us to analyze problems. This now gives a larger toolbox of ideas to work with, because we will be using any of the already existing ideas depending on how useful they are to our current investigation, in accordance to our main Axiom.

# Problem Definition

When it comes to ideas, it is important to take into account the following example from William James.

> This human witness tries to get sight of the squirrel by moving rapidly round the tree, but no matter how fast he goes, the squirrel moves as fast in the opposite direction … so that never a glimpse of him is caught. The resultant metaphysical problem now is this: Does the man go round the squirrel or not?

We can analyze the example as follows.

> James proposed that which answer is correct depends on what you ‘practically mean’ by ‘going round’. If you mean passing from north of the squirrel, east, south, then west, then the answer is ‘yes’. If, on the other hand, you mean in front of him, to his right, behind him, to his left, and then in front of him again, then the answer is ‘no’.

It should be now clear that by creating definitions, that is distinct patterns which represent ideas, we can use them to different ends. If we then decide to evaluate an idea with respect to a goal, then it is easy to actually find the solution. Had we not had a goal, with respect to which we can solve a problem, then the statement can be interpreted in infinite ways and any interpretation could be valid. Thus, it becomes useless. By constraining the definitions to those which get us to a specific goal, we can specifically choose a definition which we know will work in a certain case when solving a problem at hand.

# Problem Evaluation

The above example tells us that we should make our ideas clear before we start evaluating possible solutions to a problem. Otherwise, we cannot find the solution efficiently. Let us take into consideration the following question.

> What is better, a computer or a box of matches?

Let us analyze this question. The question we see here is actually a problem as well. It asks us to decide which object is better, a computer, or a box of matches. In reality, we might say that a computer is better, because it can be used to write text. On the other hand, we can say that a box of matches is better, because it can be used to light a fire when you want to prepare a meal. Clearly, both cases are actually being evaluated with respect to a certain goal. Thus, there could be an infinite number of cases we could use both objects, so there is no correct answer to this question and the problem is unsolvable.

Once we reformulate the question in either of the following ways, the answer becomes instantly clear.

> What is better, a computer or a box of matches, in order to write text?

and also

> What is better, a computer or a box of matches, in order to light a fire?

We can easily decide which object is better now that our problem should be evaluated with respect to a goal we are trying to achieve. This example is similar to a question posed in this manner.

> How could we?

Clearly, this is not a complete question and has no correct answer. We argue that any question, that is, a problem solving method, which does not take into, is incomplete and therefore useless and meaningless. In other words, the statement needs to be defined in terms of reaching a solution. We can now conclude that problems need to be solved with respect to a goal we are trying to achieve. Once we have formed a problem solving method in the following terms.

- Problem - starting state
- Potential solutions 
- Goal - end state

We can then apply our main Axiom and conclude that from the potential solutions, we should pick the best solution to reach the goal. If we are picking the best solution from a set of possible solutions, then we are not presented with an optimization problem and our solution is actually the optimal result. Since we are working with all possible patterns in question, we are in this case talking about a general optimization method. This method is our Pragmatic Analysis which aims to use the right tool for the right job according to our main Axiom. It does so by taking into account all possible ideas is form of patterns. It then evaluates these patterns with respect to the goal we are trying to achieve. Once evaluated, the optimal, i.e. the best solution is presented.
