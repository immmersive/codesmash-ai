# CodeSmash AI

## Author: Mario Stopfer

# ðŸ”˜ Intro

This repository serves as the primary source for both theoretical and technical work on CodeSmash AI. 
It is currently under development and will expand as more ideas are developed.

# ðŸ”˜ Motivation

The current AI landscape, as judged by the author of this paper, is in a state of a bubble. 
Furthermore, the promises of AGI cannot be achieved by simply using the LLM approach and scaling it indefinitely. 
A completely different approach is needed, one which will be presented in this paper.
