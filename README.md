# CodeSmash AI

## Author: Mario Stopfer

# Intro

This repository is the main source for theoretical and technical work on CodeSmash AI.
It is under development and will grow as more ideas have been worked out.

# Motivation

The current AI landscape is, as judged by the author of this paper, in a state of a bubble.
Furthermore, the promises of an AGI, cannot be achieved by simply using the LLM approach and scaling it indefinitely.
A com pletely different approach is needed, one which is going to be presented in this paper.
