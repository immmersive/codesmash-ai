# Ideas

Once we have understood that our method needs to solve all problems and we are going to use the right tool for the right job, we need to understand what problems and solutions actually are.

We first need to address the issue of a starting point for reasoning. We have already concluded that we at no point have the absolute truth. The materialistic or idealistic, or any other conception of reality can indeed then serve as a starting point. After all, these are all ideas which we came up with and are no more true or false in reality. Even if they were, we would not be able to establish that with absolute certainty. Seeing as how we are justified with starting from any point, we shall start from ideas. Ideas are created during the process of thinking. It is our reasoning process which creates ideas, which should be helpful in solving the problem at hand.

Our goal here, is to establish a method which will be able to evaluate any idea and give us an optimal solution.
