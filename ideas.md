# Ideas

Once we have understood that our method needs to solve all problems and we are going to use the right tool for the right job, we need to understand what problems and solutions actually are. We first need to address the issue of a starting point for reasoning. We have already concluded that we at no point have the absolute truth. Initially all our conceptions of reality come from our ideas, so we need to handle all ideas which are the source of our understanding of the concepts like problem and solution in the first place. Our goal then, is to establish a method which will be able to evaluate any idea and give us a solution.
