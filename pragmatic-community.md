 
### **Incorporating the Transition from Individual to Community in Problem-Solving**

#### **1. Objective**

To formalize the decision-making process where an individual intelligent agent (the problem solver) assesses when to involve the community (a collection of intelligent agents) to assist in solving the problem.

#### **2. Components**

- **Individual Agent $A_I$:**  
  The problem solver begins as a single intelligent agent with limited resources $R_I$ and reasoning capabilities.

- **Community of Agents $A_C$:**  
  The community is a collection of intelligent agents, each with their own resources $R_C = \{r_{n+1}, r_{n+2}, \dots, r_{m}\}$ and reasoning capabilities.

- **Threshold for Community Engagement $\theta_C$:**  
  A decision criterion that determines when the individual agent $A_I$ should seek help from the community. This threshold is based on the resource gap $\Delta R$ and the complexity of the problem.

- **Complexity of the Problem $\mathcal{C}(P)$:**  
  A measure of how difficult the problem is, considering factors like the number of patterns involved, the intricacy of their transformations, and the constraints.

#### **3. Decision-Making Process**

1. **Start as an Individual Agent:**
   - The problem-solving process begins with the individual agent $A_I$ assessing the current state $S$, the desired goal $G$, and the available resources $R_I$.
   - The agent attempts to solve the problem using individual reasoning and resources.

2. **Assess Resource Gap and Complexity:**
   - Calculate the resource gap $\Delta R = R_G - R_I$, where $R_G$ is the required resources to solve the problem.
   - Evaluate the complexity of the problem $\mathcal{C}(P)$, which might include factors like the number of patterns, the difficulty of transformations, and the constraints.

3. **Determine the Need for Community Engagement:**
   - If $\Delta R > \theta_C$ or $\mathcal{C}(P)$ exceeds the agent's capability, the individual agent considers involving the community.
   - The threshold $\theta_C$ is determined based on the individual’s resources and problem complexity. When $\Delta R$ or $\mathcal{C}(P)$ exceeds this threshold, it indicates that the problem is beyond the individual’s ability to solve alone.

4. **Engage the Community:**
   - Once the threshold is crossed, the individual agent $A_I$ reaches out to the community of agents $A_C$.
   - The community provides additional resources $\Delta R_C$ and collective reasoning to address the problem.

5. **Combined Problem-Solving:**
   - The individual and the community now work together, combining resources $R_T = R_I + \Delta R_C$ and reasoning capabilities to solve the problem.
   - The combined effort increases the likelihood of finding an optimal solution.

6. **Evaluate and Iterate:**
   - The solution is evaluated, and if further resources or reasoning are required, the community's involvement continues or expands.
   - The process is iterative, with ongoing assessment of whether additional community input is needed.

### **Optimization Problem Reformulation**

Incorporating the community decision-making process:

1. **Objective Function:**

   ```math
   \text{Minimize } \mathcal{F}(R_T) = R_G - (R_I + \Delta R_C)
   ```

2. **Community Engagement Criterion:**

   ```math
   \text{Engage community if } \Delta R > \theta_C \text{ or } \mathcal{C}(P) > \text{individual capacity}
   ```

3. **Resource Gap Constraint:**

   ```math
   R_T \geq R_G
   ```

### **Summary**

This formalization outlines the transition from individual problem-solving to community-based problem-solving. The individual agent starts with their own resources and reasoning capabilities, assessing when the problem exceeds their abilities. At that point, the community, a collection of intelligent agents, is engaged to provide additional resources and reasoning power. The decision to involve the community is based on the resource gap and the complexity of the problem, ensuring that the problem is approached with sufficient resources and intelligence to reach an optimal solution.
