### Formal Definition of the Pragmatic Problem-Solving Approach

#### 1. Objective
The goal of this approach is to find the optimal solution to a given problem by understanding and leveraging patterns and their transformations.

#### 2. Components

- **Current State (S)**: The initial condition or the problem that needs to be solved. It is represented as a set of patterns \( P<sub>S</sub> \), where each pattern is a recognizable structure or arrangement in the problem space.
  
- **Desired Goal (G)**: The target condition or outcome to be achieved. It is represented as a set of patterns \( P<sub>G</sub> \), where these patterns describe the state in which the problem is considered solved.
  
- **Constraints (C)**: Limitations or restrictions that must be respected in the problem-solving process. These are represented as rules or boundaries that govern possible transformations of patterns.
  
- **Patterns (P)**: Fundamental elements that represent structures, arrangements, or sequences within the problem. Patterns can be static (unchanging) or dynamic (subject to change over time). Each pattern \( p<sub>i</sub> \) can be defined in terms of its features and the relationships between these features.
  
- **Transformations (T)**: The process of changing patterns from the current state \( P<sub>S</sub> \) to the desired goal \( P<sub>G</sub> \). Transformations are governed by the constraints \( C \) and must be possible within the given problem space.

#### 3. The Pragmatic Problem-Solving Process

1. **Assessment of Current State**  
   - Identify and clearly define the current state \( S \) by recognizing and cataloging all relevant patterns \( P<sub>S</sub> \) present in the problem.
   - Understand the features and relationships within these patterns.

2. **Definition of Desired Goal**  
   - Define the goal \( G \) in terms of the patterns \( P<sub>G</sub> \) that should be present when the problem is solved.
   - Determine the necessary transformations \( T \) that would convert \( P<sub>S</sub> \) to \( P<sub>G</sub> \).

3. **Identification of Constraints**  
   - Clearly outline the constraints \( C \) that limit the types of transformations that can be applied.
   - Constraints may include resource limitations, time, physical laws, or other relevant factors.

4. **Pattern Recognition and Analysis**  
   - Analyze the defined patterns \( P<sub>S</sub> \) and \( P<sub>G</sub> \) to identify features and relationships that are crucial to the problem.
   - Determine which features are invariant (must remain unchanged) and which can be modified through transformation.

5. **Selection of Problem-Solving Methods**  
   - Based on the analysis, select the most appropriate problem-solving methods that align with the features and transformations needed.
   - Ensure that the methods chosen are capable of operating within the constraints \( C \) and achieving the transformation \( T \).

6. **Implementation of Transformations**  
   - Apply the selected methods to initiate the transformation from \( P<sub>S</sub> \) to \( P<sub>G</sub> \).
   - Monitor the process to ensure that the constraints are respected and that the transformation is proceeding as expected.

7. **Evaluation and Iteration**  
   - Evaluate the outcome by comparing the resulting patterns with the desired goal \( P<sub>G</sub> \).
   - If the solution is suboptimal or incomplete, revisit the previous steps, refine the definitions, and adjust the methods as necessary.

#### 4. Summary
This formal definition of the Pragmatic Problem-Solving Approach integrates the understanding of patterns, constraints, and transformations into a systematic method for achieving the optimal solution to any given problem. The approach is iterative and adaptive, allowing for continuous refinement based on the specific features of the patterns involved.
