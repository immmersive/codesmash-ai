# Justifying Radical Skepticism 

We are going to start off by attempting to justify the position of **Radical Skepticism**.

Let us imagine the following situation.

> *You are in your bed one day and you wake up. Then, you get out of bed and look out your window. As you gaze outside, you see the mountain in the distance and you feel content.*

Let us now analyze these propositions. The first thing we need to ask ourselves is, what does it mean to “see”?

- The act of observing the world, means that the Sun’s rays hit the object in the distance, in this case, the mountain.
- The rays are then reflected of the mountain and bounce into your retina.
- Once they hit the retina, they are converted into electrical signals.
- Then, they travel down the nerves and enter the brain.
- In your brain, they cause the sensation of sight.

This, in short is how we perceive the world. But this also goes for our other senses, not just sight. This would mean that everything we know about the external world around us, is actually through our senses. Here we have to conclude that we are dealing with 2 different worlds.

- The External World
- The Internal World

The external world is the world outside of our mind. The internal world is the world we experience, the world of senses inside of our mind. These are clearly 2 different world, because should it be the case that we close our eyes, the image of the world would disappear. But nobody would conclude that the external world actually disappeared. Thus, it is only the internal world which has disappeared, and it then follows, that the external and internal worlds are not one and the same. But if that is the case, then how can we say that we have any experience of the external world, since all we ever experienced is the internal world? How can we claim, that there is a 1:1 mapping between what we experience and what is outside or mind, when we have no way to confirm that?

Clearly, we cannot.

Furthermore, that means that all that we have ever experienced, the totality of the external world, was always inside our mind. Even the room we are right now. So, it is not the case that we are now located in our room, on the contrary, the room, is inside us. This leaves us to conclude that the totality of the material world, is actually inside our mind. But furthermore, this would also apply to our brain, which is part of the material world as well. Since that is so, then how can we claim that our brain, gives rise to our mind, when our brain is just an image in our mind? How can we claim any knowledge of ours to be meaningful, when all our conclusions and decisions that we have made, have been based on images in our mind?

Once again, we cannot claim that to be the case.

Most importantly, even the scientific theories of sight which we have constructed to explain what is going on when we see, are simply based on these same images inside our mind. Thus, there is only one conclusion we are left with. Our mind is locked away from the external world. We can never reach it with our mind, therefore, our reasoning process, because we have no information about the external world in the first place. So, in the end, we can only conclude that we also never came into contact with any other person either, nor gotten any information from them. The people we have reasoned with, have always been inside us. The only person we have ever talked to, has been us all along.

In the end we are left with only our mind. Since we cannot justify our mind in any way besides our mind, we have no other recourse for thought. Ultimately, justifying thoughts with thoughts is circular reasoning. There’s no reason to think that any idea can ever justify another one. But as soon as you try to justify that notion, you are justifying ideas with Ideas. Thus using circular reasoning. 

In reality, reasoning is completely meaningless because nothing can actually be deduced from something else. The idea that we can derive some idea from a previous one, by deduction, is just an idea which we cannot confirm. Even if we tried to, we would have to use a certain approach, i.e. deduction, which would be circular again. Thus, we are left with the Inference to the Best Explanation as our starting point of the reasoning process, as opposed to some a priori truth. 

# Futility of a search for Absolute Truth

Let us now suppose that there is a set I, which contains all ideas which any human mind could possibly conceive. Let us further suppose, that there is a set N, which holds all ideas that human mind is not able to hold. Let us now suppose that there exist actual truths about ultimate reality. How can we then know, that all these ideas, are not in the set N? If they are all in set N, then our search for truth is futile. Furthermore, if the way to even know whether they are in N or not, is in the set N, then we cannot even know whether we can know, whether the search for truth is meaningless or not.
 

**Definitions**

- Let $I$ represent the set of all ideas that human minds can conceive.
- Let $N$ represent the set of all ideas that human minds cannot conceive.
- Let $T$ represent the set of all true ideas that reflect the ultimate nature of reality.

**Assumptions**

```math
T \subseteq I \cup N
```
(The set of true ideas exists within the union of $I$ and $N$).

Human beings can only access and reason about the ideas in $I$.

### **Argument**:

1. **Possibility of Truth in $N$**: It is possible that $T \subseteq N$, meaning all true ideas about ultimate reality could reside in $N$, which is inaccessible to human cognition.

2. **Epistemic Limitation**: If $T \subseteq N$, then no human can access or understand the true nature of reality, since no human mind can access the set $N$ by definition.

3. **Meaninglessness of Truth-Seeking**: If $T \subseteq N$, then the human search for truth within the set $I$ is **meaningless**, because the actual truth lies entirely outside of what humans can conceive or reason about.

4. **Recursive Skepticism**: The question of whether $T$ lies within $N$ or $I$ might itself be part of $N$. If the method to determine whether the ultimate truth is in $N$ or $I$ lies within $N$, humans cannot know whether they are even able to **answer** this question.

Therefore, humans are incapable of knowing whether the search for truth is meaningful or meaningless, because that knowledge may also reside in $N$.

**Conclusion**

If there is no way for us to confirm with absolute certainty any idea we have, then no idea can be considered ultimate truth. The only thing we can conclude from this point, is that all ideas are subject to change as our process of thinking continues.
