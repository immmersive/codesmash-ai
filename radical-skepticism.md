# Jusitfying Radical Skepticism 

Ultimately, justifying thoughts with thoughts is circular reasoning. Thereâ€™s no reason to think that any idea can ever justify another one. 
But as soon as you try to justify that notion, you are justifying ideas with Ideas. 
Thus using circular reasoning.

In reality, reasoning is completely meaningless because nothing can actually be deduced from something else. 
The idea that we can derive some idea from a precious one, by deduction, is just an idea which we cannot confirm. 
Even if we tried to, we would have to use a certain approach, i.e. deduction, which would be circular again.

Thus, we are left with the Inference to the Best Explanation as our starting point of the reasoning process, as opposed to some truth.
