# Inference to the Best Explanation

We have previously already seen thathuman reasoning is limited in various ways. Since that is so, the information based on which we are reaching decisions are made on incomplete information. Yet, if we want to actually solve a problem at hand, we need to act. We shall now use our main Axiom and conclude that we should use the best knowledge at hand, to base our decision on, when trying to solve a problem. Thus from the idea of using the right tool for the right job, we can concluide that we need to use the best knowledge available to make a decision in order to solve the problem at hand.

This system of reasoning is also known as the Inference to the Best Explanation.
