# Inference to the Best Explanation

We have previously seen that human reasoning is limited in various ways. Since that is so, the information, based on which we are reaching decisions is incomplete. Yet, if we want to actually solve the problem at hand, we need to act. We shall now use our main Axiom and conclude that we should use the best knowledge at hand, to base our decision on, when trying to solve a problem. Thus from the idea of using the right tool for the right job, we can concluide that we need to use the best knowledge available to make a decision in order to solve the problem at hand.

Since whatever we currently have is the best knowledge at hand, we can proceed with problem solving based on our current information. This system of reasoning is also known as the Inference to the Best Explanation. Seeing as how the problem needs to be saved and there is no other information available, this is by definition the only and also the best information to solve the problem with.

It should also be clear that in many cases, this approach will not actually solve the problem, but since it is the only way we can proceed, we shall move forward from here.
