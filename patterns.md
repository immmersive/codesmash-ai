# Patterns

In our approach, we define everything as a pattern. Since we need to create a general problem-solving method, which can solve all problems, we need a method which is general enough to describe all problems and give us solutions. We shall represent everything as a pattern.

Everything which needs to be solved is treated as a problem, for which we need to provide a solution. Thus, the process of problem-solving is that for a given problem, we need to present a solution. We solve problems by thinking. Thinking is the process of creating ideas that represent problems and solutions. In order to submit ideas to our problem-solving method, we describe ideas using patterns. Patterns allow us to distinguish between different ideas. To describe something means to present it as a pattern. The method then comes up with ideas, describes them with patterns, evaluates them, and presents the solution.

In order to keep with our pragmatic approach, we have to keep in mind that patterns which represent solutions, need to be evaluated with respect to how well they solve the problem, therefore, we are going to use the right tool for the right job, according to our axiom. In other words, the method needs to be able to pick the correct pattern which will solve the problem and get us from teh problem to the solution.

## Patterns as Fundamental Entities:

Definition of Patterns:

- Core Idea: Everything in the world is a pattern, whether it's a shape, a sound, a movement, or an abstract concept. A pattern is a structured, recognizable configuration of elements.

- Examples: A circle is a geometric pattern; a melody is a musical pattern; walking is a movement pattern.

Types of Patterns:

- Static Patterns: These are patterns that do not change over time. For example, a geometric shape or a static image.

- Dynamic Patterns: These are patterns that evolve or change over time, such as a moving object, a conversation, or a process.

## Transformations as Fundamental Processes:

Transformation of Patterns:

- Core Idea: The world is understood in terms of how patterns transform into other patterns over time. This could involve changes in shape, position, structure, or even meaning.

- Examples: A spinning wheel (a circular pattern that moves), a sentence being spoken (a linguistic pattern that unfolds over time).

Time Component:

- Patterns with Time: Dynamic patterns have a time component that represents how they change or evolve. For example, a bouncing ball's trajectory can be seen as a pattern that changes with time.

## Constraints on Transformations:

Feasibility of Transformations:

- Core Idea: Not all pattern transformations are possible or feasible. The physical, logical, or contextual constraints limit which patterns can transform into others.

- Examples: A person cannot lift a 1000 kg rock because the pattern of a human lifting such a weight does not align with the physical capabilities of a human body.

Truth as Feasibility:

- Core Idea: An idea proposing an impossible or unfeasible transformation of patterns is considered false. Truth, therefore, is associated with the possibility of a pattern transformation.
- Examples: The statement "a person can lift a 1000 kg rock" would be false because the proposed pattern transformation is impossible under known physical laws.

## Application to Problem-Solving:

Identifying Patterns:

- First Step: Identify the relevant patterns in the problem at hand. This could be physical patterns (like the layout of objects), behavioral patterns (like how people interact), or abstract patterns (like workflows or processes).

Understanding Transformations:

- Second Step: Understand how these patterns might transform into others over time or through action. This involves recognizing what transformations are feasible and which ones are not.

Proposing Solutions:

- Third Step: Develop solutions by proposing pattern transformations that align with the goal. The feasibility of these transformations will determine the truth or viability of the proposed solution.

# Examples

- Engineering: In designing a structure, the patterns might include the shapes of materials and the forces acting on them. The transformation would be how these patterns interact (e.g., how materials bear loads), with the constraints being physical laws.

- Social Dynamics: In analyzing a social problem, the patterns could include behavioral trends and cultural norms. Transformations might involve how these patterns could change over time with interventions, with constraints being societal limits or resistance.

# Summary

By defining everything as patterns and focusing on their transformations, you've created a framework that emphasizes the fluid and dynamic nature of reality. This approach allows for a wide-ranging application, from physical sciences to social sciences and beyond. The concept that not all transformations are possible introduces a criterion for truth and falsity, which grounds the framework in practical reality. Overall, this method offers a versatile and robust way to approach problem-solving and understanding the world.
