# Patterns

In our approach, we define everything as a pattern. Since we need to create a general problem-solving method, which can solve all problems, we need a method which is general enough to describe all problems and give us solutions. We shall represent everything as a pattern.

Everything which needs to be solved is treated as a problem, for which we need to provide a solution. Thus, the process of problem-solving is that for a given problem, we need to present a solution. We solve problems by thinking. Thinking is the process of creating ideas that represent problems and solutions. In order to submit ideas to our problem-solving method, we describe ideas using patterns. Patterns allow us to distinguish between different ideas. To describe something means to present it as a pattern. The method then comes up with ideas, describes them with patterns, evaluates them, and presents the solution.

In order to keep with our pragmatic approach, we have to keep in mind that patterns which represent solutions, need to be evaluated with respect to how well they solve the problem, therefore, we are going to use the right tool for the right job, according to our axiom. In other words, the method needs to be able to pick the correct pattern which will solve the problem and get us from teh problem to the solution.

# Patterns as Fundamental Entities

Everything in the world is a pattern, whether it's a shape, a sound, a movement, or an abstract concept. A pattern is a structured, recognizable configuration of elements. A circle is a geometric pattern; a melody is a musical pattern; walking is a movement pattern. There are patterns that do not change over time. For example, a geometric shape or a static image. Then are patterns that evolve or change over time, such as a moving object, a conversation, or a process.

# Summary

By defining everything as patterns and focusing on their transformations, you've created a framework that emphasizes the fluid and dynamic nature of reality. This approach allows for a wide-ranging application, from physical sciences to social sciences and beyond. The concept that not all transformations are possible introduces a criterion for truth and falsity, which grounds the framework in practical reality. Overall, this method offers a versatile and robust way to approach problem-solving and understanding the world.
