### **Formalizing Belief and Doubt in the Context of an Optimization Problem**

#### **1. Belief as Degree of Optimality**

- **Objective:**  
  Belief is defined as the degree to which a pattern $P_S$ (current solution) fits the optimization problem, aligning with the desired goal $P_G$.

- **Belief Function $\mathcal{B}(P_S)$:**  
  We define belief as a function $\mathcal{B}(P_S)$ that measures the degree of fit between the current pattern $P_S$ and the optimal transformation $T^*(P_S)$ needed to reach the goal $P_G$. This function is a measure of optimality:

```math
\mathcal{B}(P_S) = 1 - \frac{\mathcal{F}(T^*(P_S))}{\mathcal{F}_{\text{max}}}
```

  where:
  - $\mathcal{F}(T^\*(P_S))$ is the objective function value for the optimal transformation $T^*(P_S)$ of the current pattern.
  - $\mathcal{F}_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum possible value of the objective function, representing the worst-case scenario where the pattern is completely misaligned with the goal.

  The belief function $\mathcal{B}(P_S)$ ranges from 0 to 1:
  - $\mathcal{B}(P_S) = 1$: The current pattern perfectly fits the optimization problem, indicating complete belief in the solution.
  - $\mathcal{B}(P_S) = 0$: The current pattern does not fit the optimization problem at all, indicating no belief in the solution.

#### **2. Doubt as Inverse of Belief**

- **Objective:**  
  Doubt is defined as the degree of misalignment or lack of fit between the current pattern $P_S$ and the optimal solution. It is the inverse of belief.

- **Doubt Function $\mathcal{D}(P_S)$:**  
  The doubt function $\mathcal{D}(P_S)$ can be defined as:

```math
\mathcal{D}(P_S) = 1 - \mathcal{B}(P_S) = \frac{\mathcal{F}(T^*(P_S))}{\mathcal{F}_{\text{max}}}
```

  This function measures the extent to which the current pattern deviates from the optimal solution:
  - $\mathcal{D}(P_S) = 1$: Complete doubt, indicating that the current pattern does not fit the problem at all.
  - $\mathcal{D}(P_S) = 0$: No doubt, indicating that the current pattern is fully aligned with the optimal solution.

#### **3. Belief and Doubt in the Optimization Context**

In the context of the optimization problem:

- **Maximizing Belief**:  
  The goal is to maximize the belief function $\mathcal{B}(P_S)$, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function $\mathcal{F}(T^*(P_S))$. This ensures that the current pattern is as close as possible to the optimal solution.

- **Minimizing Doubt**:  
  Minimizing the doubt function $\mathcal{D}(P_S)$ is equivalent to maximizing belief, as doubt represents the degree of misalignment between the current pattern and the optimal solution.

### **Optimization Problem Reformulation**

Given the belief function, the optimization problem can be reformulated as:

```math
\text{Maximize } \mathcal{B}(P_S) = 1 - \frac{\mathcal{F}(T^*(P_S))}{\mathcal{F}_{\text{max}}}
```

Subject to:

```math
C_j(T) \leq 0 \quad \forall j = 1, 2, \dots, k
```

### **Summary**

In this formalization, belief is the measure of how well the current pattern $P_S$ solves the optimization problem, represented as the degree of optimality. Doubt is its inverse, representing the degree of misalignment. By maximizing belief (or minimizing doubt), the problem-solving process continually refines the solution, aligning it more closely with the desired goal. This approach integrates belief and doubt into a rigorous, quantifiable framework that aligns with your overall problem-solving strategy.
