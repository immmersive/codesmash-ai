# The Pragmatic Meaning
 
### Old Pragmatic Conception of Meaning

In traditional Pragmatism, the meaning of an idea, concept, or proposition is defined by its practical consequences and effects. Meaning is determined by what difference it makes in the real world and how it influences actions and outcomes. This approach focuses on the tangible results of ideas and their utility in everyday situations.

### New Definition: Meaning as Utility in Achieving a Goal

In our problem-solving approach, meaning is redefined as the utility or effectiveness of an idea, concept, or proposition in achieving a specific goal. This definition emphasizes that meaning is context-dependent and evaluated based on how well an idea contributes to moving closer to the goal.

### Formalizing the Notion of Meaning as Utility

To formalize this reworked conception of meaning, we can define meaning in a structured way using the language of utility and goal achievement:

1. **Goal-Oriented Utility**: The meaning of an idea $I$ is directly tied to its utility $U(I, G)$, where $G$ represents the specific goal. If idea $I$ contributes to achieving goal $G$, it has meaningful content.

2. **Functional Impact**: The meaning is quantified by the functional impact of the idea, measured by how much it helps in solving the problem and achieving the goal.

3. **Actionable Definitions**: The question “What does this idea mean?” is replaced by “What can this idea do to help achieve the goal $G$?”

4. **Dynamic Interpretation**: Meaning is not static; it varies with different problem-solving scenarios and is contingent on the context in which the idea is applied.

5. **Evaluation Based on Goal Achievement**: The value and meaning of an idea are evaluated based on its effectiveness in advancing towards the optimal solution.

### Utility Function for Meaning

The utility function $U(I, G)$ that defines the meaning of idea $I$ with respect to goal $G$ can be represented as:

```math
U(I, G) = \frac{O(I, G)}{C(I)}
```

Where:
- **$O(I, G)$**: Represents the outcome or result produced by idea $I$ with respect to goal $G$.
- **$C(I)$**: Represents the cost or resources required to implement idea $I$.

### Optimization of Meaning

The optimal meaning of an idea $I^*$ is the one that maximizes the utility function:

```math
I^* = \arg\max_{I} U(I, G)
```

Thus, the "meaning" in this framework is defined as the idea $I^*$ that maximizes utility with respect to achieving goal $G$.

### Example

Suppose you have a goal of improving the efficiency of a manufacturing process. The meaning of the concept "efficiency" in this context is directly tied to the specific actions and changes that will result in a faster, cheaper, or higher-quality production process. If a proposed idea—such as automating a certain task—can clearly contribute to achieving this efficiency, then the idea has significant meaning within this context.

### Summary

In your problem-solving approach, meaning is redefined as the ability of an idea, concept, or proposition to contribute to achieving a goal. This shifts the focus from abstract or theoretical meanings to practical, goal-oriented applications, making the meaning of ideas contingent on their usefulness in solving problems.
